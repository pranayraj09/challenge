As said in my last submission, with my given timeline of current role,
i find time hardly to spend on other stuff, So i had to learn python to correct the backend first, that took
me bit longer during the weekend, as i wasn't expected python to be in the challege.
But i had great fun learning it. This is main reason i didn't spent too much time on front end and used basic JQuery.

But lately, i got time during weekdays, and implemented this beautiful approach with react.
